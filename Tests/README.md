## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run with verbose output
dotnet test --logger:"console;verbosity=detailed"

# Run specific test class
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~FragmentationAndMemoryTests"

# Run specific test method
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~TestClassName.TestMethodName"
```

This test suite ensures the UnmanagedStringPool is production-ready with enterprise-grade reliability, performance, and safety characteristics.
